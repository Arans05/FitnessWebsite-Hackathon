## üí° About The Project

FitTrack is a web application designed to help users track their fitness journey in a simple and intuitive way. It includes features for logging workouts and nutrition, visualizing progress with charts, and engaging with a community through leaderboards.

The primary goal was to build a dynamic, real-time, multi-user application without relying on any front-end frameworks like React or Vue, demonstrating the power of modern vanilla JavaScript.

    * Wrote the core `setupListeners` function that connects the front-end to the live database.

* **Raheem - Data Visualization & Nutrition:**
    * Built the "Progress" page, integrating Chart.js to create dynamic, responsive charts for weight and body fat tracking.
    * Developed the "Nutrition" page, including the UI for logging meals and the macro-tracking pie chart.
    * Wrote the helper functions for date and time calculations (`isToday`, `isThisWeek`).

* **Hashim - UI/UX & Community Features:**
    * Designed the overall user interface, including the dark/light mode theme switcher and the main navigation shell.
    * Developed the "Community" page, implementing the logic for the leaderboards, including the tabbing and timeframe filtering system.
